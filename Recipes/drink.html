    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple coffee is a clone of that overpriced name-brand bottled coffee drink I somehow became addicted to. It's also a great way to use the leftover coffee that always ends up getting dumped down the drain the next day.</P>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup cold brewed coffee</li>
        <li>2 (1 gram) packets granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix milk, coffee, and sweetener together in a glass until sweetener is dissolved.</li>\
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
